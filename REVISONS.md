Changes I would have made in hindsight

1. I would have shied away from using nested arrays as much and just used coordinate keys to create a map of all of my Cells (this came up to bite me several times during my development time)

2. I would have written more tests sooner so that I can find the part of the code that is not causing errors easier

Refactors Moving forward

1. One immediate refactor I would have done is to make a function that does an operation on every cell

2. I would have added more tests to the code

3. I would have pulled the different cell types out into their own files to help keep everything a bit more readable

4. I would have gone back and seen if there was a way for me to more easily compute the neighbors for a given cell

5. I would have put in fixes to try and make it so that my neighbors arrays were of the cells themselves instead of just the values of the neighboring cells
